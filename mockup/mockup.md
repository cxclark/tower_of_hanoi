## Tower of Hanoi

## Description

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle game consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various widths. The game begins with the disks stacked by decreasing size on a single rod, the smallest at the top. The objective is to move all the disks to the third rod, so that they are stacked in the same order. There are three rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time
2. Every move involves taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placed it on top of another stack
3. No disk can be put on top of a smaller disk
